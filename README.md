Daily recordings. Unless I forgot about this.



(12/11/21)

I have no idea what I'm doing, and it's great. Except for Tuesdays, when I'm going to have a vague idea of what I'm doing, and it's going to be Ysaye. 

I've been playing violin for around 7 years, but I can't play a single piece *well*. I'm not entirely sure how these things happen. But thereâ€™s little interesting in being able to mediocrely play only classical music.


I'm going to try to solve all the issues with my limited stylistic scope by recording something of my own, daily (not Tuesdays), and I'm choosing to believe it will work.
