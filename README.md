Daily recordings. Unless I forgot about this.



(12/11/21)

I have no idea what I'm doing, and it's great. Except for Tuesdays, when I'm going to have a vague idea of what I'm doing, and it's going to be Ysaye. 

I've been playing violin for around 7 years, but I can't play a single piece *well*. I'm not entirely sure how these things happen, but I think I have a general picture. 
Up until around a year ago, I had a strange fear of conforming to what I anything as normal. This included music from after the beginning of the 20th century. And I felt a need to
prove myself in the area of classical music by, somehow, skipping over all the violin repertoire in between watever I was doing at age 12 and the hardest piece that had 
ever been composed. I was going to be the youngest too, and all that. None of this is a good (or even remotely acceptable) way of looking at anything. 
I hope I'm more reasonable now. I've realized at least a few of the things that really should be obvious. Classical music isn't the only good music, or the best. Playing the hardest music isn't worth much if it sounds bad. 


I'm going to try to solve all the issues with my limited stylistic scope by recording something of my own, daily (not Tuesdays), and I'm choosing to believe it will work.
