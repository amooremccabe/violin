12 19 21 - It’s terrible, but it may be the best one yet. I’m not going to hold on to any illusions of consistency, yet.

12 16 21 - I’m off to a terrible start in terms of consistency. Oh well. Everything after 2:10’s pretty nice. 3:48 especially. Recording is terrible b/c of metal practice mute though. Probably no recording uploaded tommorow, but I’ll have Friday and Saturday uploaded in two days.  

12 14 21 - Really thought it’d be longer before I forgot a day. But it’s the first Ysaye Tuesday - enjoy a bad recording of a terrible playing of the first two pages of Ysaye’s 3rd violin sonata. (I think the phrasing worked for exactly 3/5 of a measure, near 2:18. Too bad I played exactly the same notes at 3:40. The whole third movement was very untidy.) 3 days so far on this piece. (Also, notes.md now has capitalized sentences. If anyone knew why 12 9 21 is being pushed to the end of the directory, that’d be grand. The order has some personality to it, but it irks me.)

12 12 21 - Old microphone again, new one’s harder to set up. First time with something resembling a theme, but it’s highly repetitve and my hands are too cold to do much. 

12 11 21 - New microphone, not set up great though. 

12 10 21 - Microphone didn't work well
