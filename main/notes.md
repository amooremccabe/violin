2 23 22 - The two month break was intentional and a crucial part of the scientific process. I *think* it sounds more fluid than 12 19 21, but it sucks in all other aspects. I had to cut this one off because my microphone started making weird noises. (Updates: I cobbled together a better loop station with an arduino, so maybe more loops. With less layers. Maybe more Ysaye, too. I’m not intuitively convinced it sounds much better than two months ago, but hey, this is what recordings are for.)

12 28 21 - (Welcome to the first Non-Ysaye Ysaye Tuesday!) Another loop. I prefer this one, but the tin foil sounds (my loop station is a makey makey) need to go.

12 27 21 - First time with a loop thing. I forgot to record as I was putting the loop together, so I had to play back the pieces later, which didn’t work well (especially at end). My rhythm is also pretty bad, so things sound not crisp.

12 19 21 - It’s terrible, but it may be the best one yet. I’m not going to hold on to any illusions of consistency, yet.

12 16 21 - I’m off to a terrible start in terms of consistency. Oh well. Everything after 2:10’s pretty nice. 3:48 especially. Recording is terrible b/c of metal practice mute though. Probably no recording uploaded tommorow, but I’ll have Friday and Saturday uploaded in two days.

12 14 21 - Really thought it’d be longer before I forgot a day. But it’s the first Ysaye Tuesday - enjoy a bad recording of a terrible playing of the first two pages of Ysaye’s 3rd violin sonata. (I think the phrasing worked for exactly 3/5 of a measure, near 2:18. Too bad I played exactly the same notes at 3:40. The whole third movement was very untidy.) 3 days so far on this piece. (Also, notes.md now has capitalized sentences. If anyone knew why 12 9 21 is being pushed to the end of the directory, that’d be grand. The order has some personality to it, but it irks me.)

12 12 21 - Old microphone again, new one’s harder to set up. First time with something resembling a theme, but it’s highly repetitve and my hands are too cold to do much.

12 11 21 - New microphone, not set up great though.
